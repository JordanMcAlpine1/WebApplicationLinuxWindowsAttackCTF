# Web Application, Linux, Windows Attack CTF

## Description  

This project focuses on improving the security, performance, and manageability of a Linux system by implementing various system hardening measures and best practices. The tasks are designed to address potential vulnerabilities, streamline system operations, and ensure compliance with security standards.

## Operating System  

- **Linux**
- **Windows**

## Skills Gained and Excercised

- **Web Application Penetration Testing**
   - Discovered and exploited vulnerabilities such as XSS (reflected and stored), SQL injection, command injection, and local file inclusion.
   - Used tools like Burp Suite and cURL to analyze and manipulate web traffic.
   - Gained access to sensitive information through improper input validation and weak session management.
 
- **Linux Server Exploitation**
   - Conducted network reconnaissance using Nmap and Nessus to identify open ports and vulnerabilities.
   - Exploited vulnerabilities such as Shellshock, Apache Struts RCE, and privilege escalation flaws.
   - Gained unauthorized access by leveraging weak credentials and SSH misconfigurations.
 
- **Windows Server Exploitation**
   - Identified open ports and running services through network scanning.
   - Exploited SLMail, scheduled tasks, and cached credentials for privilege escalation.
   - Used Metasploit modules to execute remote exploits and gain shell access.
   - Extracted user credentials and cracked password hashes using John the Ripper and Mimikatz.
